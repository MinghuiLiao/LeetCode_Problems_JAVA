//639. Decode Ways II
/**
 * A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the
 * following mapping way:
 * 
 * 'A' -> 1 'B' -> 2 ... 'Z' -> 26 Beyond that, now the encoded string can also
 * contain the character '*', which can be treated as one of the numbers from 1
 * to 9. Given the encoded message containing digits and the character '*',
 * return the total number of ways to decode it. Also, since the answer may be
 * very large, you should return the output mod 109 + 7.
